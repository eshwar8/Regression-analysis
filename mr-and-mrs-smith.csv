WOMAN
We got married
"apart,     on separate"

in '81. It was my

dream to meet a tall     guy and have a
big wedding.   Since then -

It's    gone downhill          on a rail.

WOMAN
When we met I loved everything
about him. I'd say 90% of the

want to puke.

She's     let    herself     go.
WOMAN
"He used to be so cute, one day he"
walks in looks like a toad. Don't
you think he looks like a toad?
He does.
WOMAN( CONT' D)
Imagine wakin' up next to that                    for
32 years.
CUT TO:

"COUPLE, 60S"
MAN
Marriage is about Trust.     Period.
"You can have attraction,     shared"
"interests,    if you don't have trust"
"it's    like you got an anchor,   an"
"eighty foot sail,    and no boat ."

Yes. I did.
Jane sits down at a table for one. She stares around the

Very much alone. On Christmas Eve. A single tear rolls   down
