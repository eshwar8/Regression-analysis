inside the borders of
Afghanistan -- They were
delivering medical supplies and
also doing fact-finding on why
the Afghanistan freedom
fighters aren't getting the
financial and weapon support
so-claimed. It was a simple
op that ran into complications.
All the facts aren't in~ But
"what we think is, that he was"
captured by Afghan Government
"troops near the Khyber Pass,"
and turned over to the reaion's
Soviet commander.        -

Is he alive?

What do you want with me?
GRIGGS
Because of the success of your
"last mission, I've been asked"
by the powers that be to get
"Trautman and crew back, before"
their capture can be used as
anti-American propaganda by the
Soviets. We'd like you to help

determined not to be slaves.
Every year the death grows.
Yet the world does not see
this; they see us only as
savages who live in a savage
land. So we must fight harder.
We are Mujahideen -- holy
"warriors -- To us, this war is"
"a Jihad, a holy war. Because"
"it is a war to defend our faith,"
a war against an infidel an
athiest power that believe in
no God or faith -- In a holy
war there is no true death.
