#Import all necessary packages for Logistic regression analysis:  Pandas, numpy, matplotlib,train_test_split,XGboost,Multinomial NB


#Define the dataset with good variables:
Upload a dataset that shows the (Y)dependent variable - categorical overall performance of candidates(Good or Not Good) 
The (X) indepedendent variable having categorical and numerical variables to judge Y are: -
- The numerical variables comprising of: 
  a. Under Graduation, 
  b. 12th in percent, 
  c. 10th in percent & 
  d. Work experience in months  
- The independent categorical variable comprising of : 
  a. Gender (female or male)
  
  
#Data cleaning:-
Convert the character names of categorical columns into category variables using ".astype(category)". This produces results as 0,1,2,3,4 or 5 etc.
Do a short EDA Analysis like the count of dependent categorical variables - performance using seaborn plot() function



#Main modelling work:- 
Once the EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) is done, divide the data in two pairs of train and test both for X and Y variables.
So there will be Y Train, Y test, X train and X test. 

Derive a logitmodel using sm.Logit() function for X Train and Y Train data. 
Derive Xgboost model from X Train and Y train data using XGBClassifier() function. 
Derive the Multinomial naive bayes model using "MultinomialNB().fit" for the same.



#Results of the model by testing it:-
Find the summary for all the 3 models using model.summary(). 
Run all the 3 models on test data get the accuracy by using .predict() and accuracy_score() functions

Come up with a classification report of accuracy defined in terms of precision,recall and f1 score. 

Decide which is the suitable model out of the 3 models & derive conclusion.
