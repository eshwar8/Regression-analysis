FADE IN:
EXT. STREET #1 - NIGHT
A pick-up truck backs up with a bed full of Miami STREET
"KIDS, out having a good time. One particular HOMBRE jumps"
"out of the back and plops a big stolen ""STREET CLOSED"" sign"
in the intersection.
He hops back in and as the truck moves down to repeat the
"pattern, a squad car rolls up. Two OFFICERS sit quietly,"
watching the crazy kids in the truck put out their signs.
OFFICER ONE
I didn't know they were racing
tonight.
Officer Two holds up a wad of cash.
OFFICER TWO
"Yeah, this was in my locker."
The cruiser turns and heads the other way.

THE CAMERA THEN MOVES across the street to find a whole TEAM
"OF TRUCKS, and even more kids, putting out signs."

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 2
where we find EDWIN BISHOP walking with a slight limp past
"a dumpster. He's in the shadows, listening to a hand-held"
two-way radio.

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT 3
"And for the first time, we see his familiar face."
EDWIN
Fire 'em up! We go live in five.
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an explosion of colors -- BOOTY BABES and RABBLE ROUSERS of every ethnicity standing
"amongst a bevy of superior machinery, the latest and greatest"
street racing imports.
The colors of the cars stand in stark contrast to the grays
and blacks of inner-Miami.
"Edwin limps through the crowd, and THE CAMERA PICKS HIM UP"
and follows
EDWIN (cont'd)
"Streets are clear, y'all. Let's"
"go, let's go"

"THE CAMERA STOPS on three DRIVERS, all leaning on the"
"hoods of their cars: a black guy named SLAP-JACK, an Asian"
"chick named SUKI, and ORANGE JULIUS, an Hispanic Don Juan."

EDWIN (cont'd)
You cats are first wave. What's up
with your fourth?
ORANGE JULIUS
"It was Joaquin, but he gotta work"
graveyard. How bout you run with
"us, Edwin?"
EDWIN
"Nah. Not tonight, man. Either you find another driver or you don't"
race.
Edwin starts to limp off as the three drivers look at each
"other. Before he takes two steps, Edwin stops and turns."
EDWIN (cont'd)

you.
SUKI
Yeah? We'll take him.
EDWIN
No matter who it is?
The three drivers are afraid to back down at this point.
SUKI
"Yeah, sure."
"Edwin smiles at Suki and moves off, pulls out a CELL PHONE"
and hits a speed dial.
EDWIN
(into the phone)
You wanna run?
(listens)
You got four minutes.

INT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 4
"A FIGURE stands in a towel, wet, his back to us, the phone at"
his ear. A giant black and white mural of Steve McQueen's
face covers one wall of this little room.
The figure immediately slaps the phone on to a dresser. He
"quickly pulls up a pair of pants, and throws on a T-shirt."
A key ring dangles from a small stand next to the phone on
the dresser. The keys are snatched up.

EXT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - GARAGE - NIGHT
The figure races up the ramp and into an old garage.
INT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - GARAGE - NIGHT
SERIES OF QUICK CLOSE-UPS:
A key twists in a door lock.
The door pops open.
The key is popped in the ignition and the engine roars to
life.A foot stomps the accelerator.
Tires peel out.

EXT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - GARAGE - NIGHT 10
The most beautiful Nissan Skyline we've ever seen roars out
of the garage and cuts into South Florida traffic.
EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT 11
Even more kids are hurrying down the street to line up for
"the races. The place has turned into a zoo, the atmosphere"
electric.
EXT. STREET #2 - NIGHT 12
The Skyline swerves between cars like a bat out of hell. It
finds a side street and barrels down it.

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT 13
The three drivers climb into their cars -- Orange Julius's
"MAXIMA, Slap-Jack's HONDA 2000, Suki's MR2 -- and the CAMERA"
QUICKLY TRACKS along the starting line as each car pulls into
position.
Then an engine ROAR erupts amongst the growing crowd.
"The Skyline parts the crowd like Moses, and we see the"
reactions of the three other drivers: 'Oh shit.'
EDWIN
There's our fourth.
"The Skyline rolls into position, stopping perfectly at the"
starting line.
"The CAMERA THEN RISES, revealing the driver: BRIAN O'CONNOR."
Edwin walks up and they bump fists.
EDWIN (cont'd) Brian the Bullitt.
BRIAN
"Thanks for the invite, Edwin."
EDWIN
(smiling)
Just remember me when you wax.
"Brian starts to hand Edwin a roll of money, looks over at"
"Orange Julius, parked next to him."
BRIAN
Let's kick it a nickel.
ORANGE JULIUS
Hold up. Nobody said nothin' bout
raising the stakes!
Brian looks back at the crowd packing in around the cars.
BRIAN
Then ask these nice people to back
off the line so you can head home.
The crowd starts LAUGHING.
OJ looks in his rearview mirror and sees everyone packed
behind him.

ORANGE JULIUS
"Shit. 'Awright, man, thirty-five"
large.
He hands the money to Edwin who moves to Slap-Jack.
SLAP-JACK
Thirty-five hundred?

Slap Jack looks at his four YOUNGER BROTHERS who look and
dress just like him and slap him various handshakes.
SLAP-JACK (cont'd)
"Yeah, I'm in."
Next is Suki. Edwin leans into her window.
EDWIN
"Damn, Suki. When am I gonna get"
you to pop my clutch?
She hands him a wad of money.
SUKI
Just say the word.
"Edwin steps back, smiling."
EDWIN
All right. All right.

"Brian surveys the scene, notices one particular woman. MONICA"
"CLEffSNTE, in the crowd. She's different than the rest of the"
"girls. Confident, beautiful, and cool, she seems to be"
watching only him.

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
Edwin takes a position in front of the cars.
EDWIN
"Okay, here we go. Be alert!"
"(beat, smiling)"
Cuz I gotta surprise for y'all
tonightl
"In the Skyline, Brian cl2ses his eyes, visualizing. His"
eyelids tense and flex as the eyes whip around behind the
closed lids.

"He's seeing the course, what he's gonna do, his hands moving"
"over the apex boost controller, his nitrous switch modes,"

"Outside, Edwin raises his arms, but Brian still has his eyes"
"closed, still visualizing."
"Suddenly, Edwin drops his arms and Brian seems to sense it"
"ha,m:,ening, his eyes popping open."
BAM! tires SQUEAL as the cars take off.
"The CAMERA SITS behind one of Brian's tires, and flecks of"
black rubber BOUNCE OFF THE LENS as it rips up the asphalt.

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
"Brian's second off the line, just behind Slap-Jack. The four *"
"cars shoot to the end of a street, crowds of on-lookers"
including the beautiful woman -- blurring around them.
EXT. RACE ONE - STREET #1 - NIGHT 19
"Just when we think they're going to head straight for a wall,"
"the four cars brake hard, the brake discs glowing red from *"
the incredible force!
"The cars whip into a right turn and head down another street, *"
Slap-Jack's Honda almost clipping the front of Brian's *
Skyline as he takes the inside.
"Brian has to go high in the turn, forcing OJ even higher, off *"
"the street on to the sidewalk, almost hitting the wall of a"
"warehouse. OJ gets his car back on the street, precious *"
seconds lost as Suki's MR2 whips by him.

EXT. RACE ONE - STREET #2 - NIGHT

"Brian has Slap-Jack right in front of him, and every time he *"
"tries to go around, Slap-Jack matches his move, staying in *"
front. He can really drive. Just behind is Suki.
"They look like they're heading into a dead end again, which"
"is when they whip into another right, the momentum of the"
turn throwing them perilously close to leaving the street. *

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
Edwin speaks into his radio.
EDWIN
"Yo, Sal. Hit it."
INT. BRIDGE CONTROL HUT - DAY

"An Asian kid stands in the bridge control hut, looking over a"
big power console. The door behind him has obviously been
"jimmied open. He presses a red button marked ""LIFT.."

EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
"Edwin points to the bridge on Canal Street, which"
miraculously is starting to rise.
EDWIN
How you like that?
"Everyone sees it rising, creating a jump!"
EDWIN (cont'd}
I told you I had a surprise.
The crowd goes nuts.
OMITTED
EXT. RACE ONE - STREET #3 - NIGHT

"The race continues down this stretch, industrial warehouses"
and loading docks visually warp as the cars let it loose.
"From a dock, we see the cars go by at well over a hundred,"
the blurred color of each letting us see just how fast these
rice rockets move.
"OJ is able to catch up to Suki, so only thirty yards separate *"
the four cars.
"They strain their cars into the red, nobody about to give"
ground. Brian looks intently at Slap-Jack. *
"Sure enough, Slap-Jack downshifts hard as they move into the *"
"third turn, and slides out more than he meant to, allowing"
Brian to cut inside so that the two cars are side by side.
"Brian and Slap-Jack look at each other for just a second, *"
Slap-Jack's shocked Brian was able to work in next to him. *

EXT. CANAL BRIDGE - NIGHT
"The bridge stops in position, locking into an angle that"
makes a wicked little jump.

EXT. RACE ONE - CANAL BRIDGE STREET - NIGHT

Brian and Slap-Jack look up and see the raised bridge for the *
first time! Slap-Jack CURSES as Brian clenches his jaw and *
races for the jump.
EXT. FINISH LINE - NIGHT 30
"The finish line is another block beyond the bridge, and all"
"of the ON-LOOKERS peer at the jump, eager for the fireworks."
EXT. CANAL BRIDGE - NIGHT 31
"Brian grits his teeth, presses the nitrous button on hie"
steering wheel and leaves Slap-Jack behind. He hits the jump *
"at 150, his car leaping through the air, land~ng well past"
"the downslope of the other side of the bridge, but on all"
four tires.
Slap-Jack's car takes the jump just after Brian's lands. He *
"lands hard on his back tires, and when his front tires hit *"
"they EXPLODE from the force of the landing. Under his car, *"
"his oil pan bursts and oil gushes out, leaving a trail of oil *"
.on the pavement as the Honda slides and slams side-ways into *
a brick wall. *

EXT. CANAL BRIDGE - NIGHT

"Suki and OJ reach the bridge. The two cars jump in tandem, *"
"coming down at the same time, racing for second and third. *"
"Both downshift hard to get control of their cars, fire *"
spitting from their tailpipes. *
The fire ignites the oil that leaked from Slap-Jacks busted *
"pan, sending a snake of fire along the oil skid in the *"
street! *

EXT. FINISH LINE - NIGHT 36
The hottest technique in street driving right now is *
"""drifting."" Brian throws his car into a drift across the *"
finish line and stops. *
He emerges from behind the wheel and looks back at Slap- *
"Jack's car, worried. Slap-Jack climbs out, pissed, and kicks *"
"his banged up car, the fire in the street burning itself out. *"
The crowds come in to greet Brian like a conquering hero.
"Brian looks for the beautiful woman, but spots her walking"
"away from the crowd, leaving by herself."
"Edwin limps up and hands him the cash, snapping Brian's"
"reverie, the whole time working the crowd like P.T. Barnum."
EDWIN
Did y'all see that shit? That's my
"man, Bullitt. Damn! You can't"
find this dope on pay-per-view. This is the real deal!
The crowd loves it.
Brian looks at Edwin.
BRIAN
Thanks for the call.
He flips him a few hundred off the roll.
EDWIN
Bout time we look at some real
class.
Edwin holds up the bills to the crowd of racers and onlookers.
EDWIN (cont'd)
You see how you supposed to act
round here. This is called mutual
respect. Something I guess they
only have on the West Coast.
He gets nothing but CATCALLS and LAUGHTER.
EDWIN (cont'd) All right. Screw all y'all. I'm

"Suddenly, a bevy of black sedans busts out on to the street."

EDWIN (cont'd) What the hell? I paid the cops

BRIAN
That's not Miami P.D.
Slap-Jack's brothers all shout at once.
SLAP-JACK'S BROTHERS
Feds! l !

Everyone scurries like ants on a stepped-on anthill. Cars
dissipate faster than tickets for a Ja Rule concert.
Edwin looks at Brian.
EDWIN
I know they ain't after me. You
"better get ghost, Brian."
Brian jumps in the Skyline and roars away.
"All over the street, black sedans rip from three different"
"directions, blocking access to the alleys."
Two of the trucks that were carrying the street closed signs
"suddenly burst through a chain-link fence, creating an escape for all the import cars. The racers follow the trucks to"
freedom like water pouring through a sieve.
INSIDE A FED'S CAR:
"Driving the car is AGENT DUNN, late 20's, and he works the"
"wheel, trying to get a bead on Brian's car."
AGENT DUNN
(into a radio) Nissan Skyline. Got him.
ON THE STREET:
Dunn attempts to cut off Brian but Brian easily out-maneuvers
Dunn and at the last second races down an unblocked alley.
EXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT 37
He looks in his rearview and sees Dunn try to. make the turn.
Dunn can't quite do it and his car slams into an abandoned
"couch, stuffing from the couch going everywhere."

"Brian races down the alley, where another FED CAR pulls up at"
the end of the alley. Brian snakes the Skyline around the *
"car, and thinks he's got clear sailing outta there. *"
"He looks in his rearview and sees a d~rk-suited, smarmy Fed, *"
"AGENT MARKHAM., climb out of the car and point a device that"
looks like a rocket launcher at Brian's car.
IN BRIAN'S CAR:
Brian's eyes go wide as he looks at the Fed holding the
strange weapon.
BRIAN
"Oh, shit."
ON THE STREET:
Markham pulls the trigger and a device that looks like a
"plunger shoots like a dart out of the gun, rips through the"
"air, and smashes on to the back of Brian's car, sticking *"
there.
"An electrical charge rips from the device, killing the entire"
electrical system.
Brian's computer pops in his passenger seat and sparks fly
from his dashboard as the car loses energy.
"He pumps the brakes, nothing. He jerks the wheel and the car"
slides sideways crashing into the outside of a STRIP JOINT.
Brian's fucked. He squints in the bright headlights as the
"Feds approach, guns drawn."
INT. FBI OFFICE - NIGHT
"Brian is shoved rudely to a chair, his hands cuffed behind"
"him, looking sullen, as Agent Markham and Agent Dunn grill"
him.
AGENT MARKHAM
Brian O'Conner. Formerly of the
L.A.P.D. Let his man go and went
on the run for the last two years.
BRIAN
You got the wrong guy.
AGENT MARKHAM
Really?

"Just then, AGENT BILKINS, the black Fed from the first movie,"
steps out.
BILKINS
(smart ass)
"How you doing, O'Conner?"
"Brian takes one look at him, winces."
BRIAN
"Better than you, Bilkins. I see"
you quit working out.
BILKINS
Still the funny man. Let's talk.
EXT. FBI - ROOF TOP - DAWN 39
The sun is starting to come up in Miami. From the rooftop of
"the federal building, the city looks like a giant playground,"
"a mixture of white concrete and deep, blue ocean."
"Bilkins takes the cuffs off of Brian, walks over to the edge"
"of the building, looks out at the city."
BILKINS
We've had you for three months.
Did you really think we wouldn't
find you?
"Brian doesn't answer, just stares at the streets he was"
racing in hours earlier.
"BILKINS (cont'd) Why'd you let him go? In L.A., I"
mean.
BRIAN
You wouldn't understand.
BILKINS
(shrugs)
"It's pretty common, really. Agents"
going dark on their first
"undercover job, a little bit of"
Stockholm syndrome. We got --
BRIAN
"It was her, wasn't it?"
BILKINS
Who?

BRIAN
At the races. The woman who's been
showing up. She's yours.
BILKINS
(smiling)
You still think like a cop.
BRIAN
So what is it you want?
BILKINS
What makes you think we want
something?
BRIAN
"Because she was scouting me, and"
"instead of arresting me, you and I"
are standing on a roof.
Bilkins smiles.
INT. FBI - WAR ROOM - DAY

The Feds sit in a war room: displays of DRUG CARTEL FIGURES
and maps of Miami cover the walls. Computer screens around
the room show a sophisticated amount of surveillance. It's
obvious: these guys have been working this for a long time.
Brian sits at a table.
BILKINS
We want you to drive.
BRIAN
For you? Forget it.
BILKINS
Not for us. For him.
"Markham flips up a picture of a tan, well-dressed man in his"
30's. CARTER VERONE.
AGENT MARKHAM
carter Verone. Local import/export
mogul.
Brian checks out the photo.
AGENT MARKHAM (cont'd)
"For the cartels, getting drugs into"
Miami is the easy part. It's
getting the money out that's hard.
BRIAN
He's a'runner?
AGENT MARKHAM
The best. We've been surveilling
"him for nearly a year, but we've"
never gotten him and the drug proceeds together. We've swept his
"house four times, all his"
"warehouses, but we keep pulling"
zeroes.
BILKINS

BRIAN

grand are monitored.
BILKINS
That's right.
(re: Markham) The field office has done a great
job. Washington sent me in to help
get them over the top.

It's obvious Markham is not happy about this arrangement.
AGENT MARKHAM
{nodding)
"We've got an agent undercover,"
working logistics for him. Setting
"up his trucks, his travel plans,"
airplane tickets. All his
"legitimate business, which he has"
in spades.
BILKINS
And recently he told her he was
looking for some below-the-line
drivers to make a drop. Tw'o of
'em. It's our chance to bag him
with his hand in the cookie jar.
BRIAN
(putting it together)
The woman at the races. She's.your mark on Verone?
Bilkins nods.
AGENT MARKHAM
You're gonna roll with Agent

Brian checks out Dunn casually while Bilkins continues.
BILKINS
All you gotta do is get Verone and
his drug money together and we'll
have what we need.
BRIAN
I'm not interested.
BILKINS
We're not giving you a choice.
BRIAN
I can walk.
Bilkins holds up a piece of paper with his right hand.
BILKINS
Here's a list of all the laws you
broke in L.A. Obstruction of

BRIAN
I don't see any proof.
He holds up another with his left.
BILKINS
And here's a list of every law
we've personally witnessed you break in Miami. You're looking at
"12 to 15, maybe more."
MARKHAM
I doubt the joint would be too
comfortable for a former cop.
BILKINS
"Of course, we could make it all go"
"away in the ""interest of justice."" ll you want to play ball."

BRIAN
"We're supposed to be street racers,"
right?
(challenging Dunn)
(MORE)

BRIAN (cont'd)
"So tell me, Dunn, what's the better"
engine for an EVO? A Gallo 12 or
24? .
Dunn is obviously caught off guard.
AGENT DONN
(recovering)
The 24.
BRIAN
Really? I didn't know pizza places
made Mitsubishi engines.
Brian nods at the coffee cup in Dunn's hand. It says:
"""Gallo's Pizza, home of the 24-incherl"""
AGENT MARKHAM
He's a good driver. That's the

BRIAN
A good driver? Last night he left
more rubber on the road in one turn
than I did my entire race. I'd be
dead inside an hour with him. If
"that's all you're givin' me, I'll"
take my chances in Chino.
Bilkins snatches up another list of agents.
BILKINS
(to Markham) Check the other pool. Tell Flagler

BRIAN
"Naaw, screw that Bilkins. The only"
way I do this is if I pick the
other driver.

BILKINS
"All right, O'Conner. Who you got"
in mind?

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BULL RING - DAY 41 *
"It's a dusty old arena, the stands populated with MEXICAN *"
LABORERS and a few trailer-park LOCALS. *

In the dusty ring a Demolition Derby is under way. Giant *
muscle cars and old sedans smash into each other like
battering rams. *
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
Brian leads Bilkins up a tunnel into the stands. He can't
believe his eyes as he looks down at the scene.
BILKINS
You gotta be kidding me.
EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY

"Just 'then, an OLDSMOBILE rams into the front of a wounded *"
"DODGE CHARGER, the front tires riding up on to the hood. It *"
"tries to back down, but can't. Both cars are incapacitated. *"
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
"Bilkins looks around the stands, then reads from a file he"
has in his hand.
BILKINS
Roman Pearce? He's got quite a
"record, including three years"

house arrest now. Can't go more
than 100 yards from his home. You
sure he's here?
Brian nods at the ring.
EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY

"Suddenly, a jet-black '71 MONTE CARLO whips around, zeroing *"
"in on the defenseless vehicles. It hauls ass at them, *"
"kicking up a cloud of dirt in its wake, homing in on the *"
place where the two cars are joined together. *
"At the last second, the Monte Carlo spins a 180 in the dust, *"
keeping its momentum and smashing the dead cars like a bolt *
"of lightning, flipping the Oldsmobile over one and a half *"
"times on to its back, and pounding the Charger into the wall, *"
pinning it there like a cockroach. *
"The crowd winces with ""Ooohs"" and ""Aahhhs"" raining down in"
torrents.
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
BILKINS
In the Monte Carlo?

BRIAN
Yep.
EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY 47
"Sure enough, behind the wheel is ROMAN PEARCE, a young guy"
"who oozes cool. He's wearing a tank-top, his shoulders huge,"
his pipes like boulders. He works the pedals as well as a
man can with a bulky anklet attached to his leg.
He whips his head around and accelerates off the Olds.
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
BRIAN
You're gonna have to get his anklet
"removed to take him to Miami,"
right?
BILKINS
Already have a judge on it.
BRIAN
Then I got one other request.
Clean the rest of his record. He
deserves a break.
BILKINS
I can't make any promises.
EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY
"Pearce spins around and flies the Monte Carlo backwards,"
steering it equally well in reverse.

"A GTO tries to get out of the way, but Pearce rams it with"
"the tail of his car, right into the driver's door, crippling"
it and knocking it through the far wall.
The crowd climbs higher in the seats to get away from the
"destruction. As soon as the danger passes, they quickly reassemble as close to the action as possible, even though a"
car is now stuck with them in the stands.
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
BILKINS
How long you known him?
BRIAN
We grew up on the same street.

EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY 51
"Pearce whips his head back around, shifting the car into"
"drive. He tries to roll forward, but his bumper is stuck on"
"the GTO's wheel well. He peels his tires out, but they just"
kick up dirt.
He looks up through his windshield just in time to catch a
"blue TRANS-AM fly out of nowhere and smash into a Camaro,"
tearing it apart and flipping it over into a pile of junked
cars.
"The DRIVER of the Trans-Am smiles at the destruction, and"
"turns his attention to Pearce, who is a sitting duck. Pearce *"
narrows his eyes at the guy.
He and the Trans-Am are the only two cars left. The TA
circles around like Jaws and zeroes in for the kill.
Pearce has just enough time to brace himself as the Trans-Am
"hits him flush, bashing in his driver's door."
"Instead of flipping, Pearce's Monte Carlo pulls free of the"
"GTO, but his hood pops up into the windshield and sticks"
"there, shattering the glass and blocking his view."
"Meanwhile, the Trans-Am backs up and circles for another run."
"Blinded by the hood, Pearce rips the rearyiew mirror off the"

catch the TA hauling ass at him in the reflection. Pearce
"guns it, using the mirror as a guide, and expertly maneuvers"
his car through the wrecked corpses of other cars.
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
BRIAN
He used to race this old Mustang in
the desert. No one could touch
him.
"(in awe, to himself)"
"Man, can he drive."
BILKINS
How's this end?
BRIAN
When only one car can move.
EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY
The Trans Am narrowly misses him and crashes into the GTO.

Pearce grabs on to his seat belt strap with both hands and
rips it free from the seat. He then kicks out the shattered
"windshield of his car and crawls through, slamming the hood."
"He runs the belt through the front loops, tying it off."
The crowd is going ape-shit.

on him. At the last second Pearce dives through the
"windshield, spins behind the wheel, pumps the gas, and the"
"Monte Carlo bolts forward, so that the Trans-Am just gets the"
tail.
"Pearce steers into the spin and his car responds, whipping"
"around, so that his grill is practically touching the TransAm's driver-side door."
The driver of the TA realizes he's been outmaneuvered and is
about to get smashed. Panic hits his face.
"Pearce guns the car forward, driving the Trans-Am into the"
"wall. But he doesn't stop, his bumper up under the TransAm's chassis, still gunning it, until the Trans-Am flips up"
into the crowd. On-lookers once again race away from the
"damage, trying to get to higher ground, as Pearce continues"
to gun it.
"Finally, Pearce pulls the Monte Carlo back and the Trans-Am"
drops like discarded garbage.
The crowd goes crazy as Pearce backs up to the center of the
ring.
EXT. BULL RING - STANDS - DAY
Brian and Bilkins start down through the crowd.
EXT. BULL RING - ARENA - DAY

"Pearce raises his fist out the window, victorious, then"
steers the car out of the arena to the thunderous APPLAUSE of
the crowd.
EXT. BULL RING - CATTLE HOLDING PEN - DAY 56
Brian and Bilkins walk into this dingy little pen under the
rodeo ring.
"Pearce stands there, holding a small wad of cash, arguing"
"with a Mexican man, the PROMOTER."
The promoter says something in Spanish and points at the
money.
PEARCE
I don't know what the hell you're
"saying, bruh. I just know I'm"
about 50 light here.

The promoter again goes off in Spanish. Pearce tries to
understand but just doesn't get it.
PEARCE (cont'd)
I got a better idea. How bout you
shut the hell up and pay me my De
Niro!
"Just as Pearce reaches for the man, five other MEXICANS pour from a door, ready to rumble. They are on Pearce in a flash."
"He does his best, throwing as many punches as he can, but"
he's just too outnumbered.
Brian races in and smashes one of the Mexicans in the face.
"For a second, it's a melee."
Then a loud whistle gets everyone's attention.
Everyone looks over and sees Bilkins holding up his badge.
BILKINS
La policia.
"Pearce assesses the situation, spies Brian and his eyes go"
"hard. Instead of saying anything, he wheels on the promoter."
PEARCE
Just give me my damn money.
BRIAN
"(to the promoter, in"
Spanish)
You better pay the man.
The promoter produces a small wad of bills and Pearce
immediately snatches it out of his hand.
"He turns and walks out, past Brian and Bilkins, without a"
word.
BRIAN (cont'd)
"(to Bilkins) Whatever happens, just let this"
next one go.
BILKINS
Next one?


EXT. BULL RING - PARKING LOT - DAY

"Pearce just walks across the lot, his anklet gleaming in the"
desert sun.
BRIAN
Pearce!
"Pearce stops, turns."
PEARCE
"What you want, cop? Need to pad"
the stats a little bit?
(re: his ankle bracelet)
You still got me on my leash. That
not good enough for ya?
BRIAN
I'm not a cop anymore.
PEARCE
"Yeah, right."
BRIAN
I quit.
Pearce walks toward Brian.
PEARCE
{shouts to Bilkins)
That true? Golden-boy here quit?
BILKINS
(shouts back)
It's true. No badge.
PEARCE
So he's got no authority?
BILKINS
Far from it.

BAM! Hits Brian with a massive right cross. The two go at
"it, trading blows like two kids that have done this more than"
once.
"Bilkins sighs and sits in the only shade, on the steps of a"
"silver Airstream motor home, watching these two guys throw"
down.

"After one particular nasty exchange, Brian and Pearce are"

PEARCE
"Why'd you come back here, man?"
BRIAN
To make my peace.
PEARCE
Nice start.
BRIAN
I've got a deal for you.
PEARCE
Go to hell. I've seen the kind of
deals you hand out.
BRIAN
Come to Miami and drive with me.
PEARCE
Drive with you?
BRIAN
"I've arranged it. You do this,"
that anklet comes off for good and
the Feds wipe your record clean.
"Pearce looks over at Bilkins, the Fed."
PEARCE
"Come on, man. I know you better"
than that.
BRIAN
Maybe you don't.
"Brian stands and offers Pearce a hand. Pearce looks at it,"
then just stands on his own and walks towards Bilkins at the
Airstream.
BILKINS
You guys finished?
PEARCE
You can get this thing off my
ankle?
BILKINS
If you do this job for us.

"Pearce nods, starts to walk past him."
BILKINS (cont'd)
I thought you couldn't go more than
a hundred yards from your home.
PEARCE
Why you think I gotta park so close
to the ring?

"With that, he climbs past Bilkins and into the motor home."
DISSOLVE TO:
OMITTED 58
EXT. BULL RING - PARKING LOT - DAY SSA
"Through the front windshield of their rental car, Brian and"
Bilkins watch Pearce lock up his trailer. He's got a halfdozen different locks for his shitty rig.
BILKINS
What aren't you telling me about
you and him?
BRIAN
We grew up together. Dad wasn't
"around and my mom worked, so I"
stayed at Pearce's house most of
the time when I was a kid. Up
"through high school, we did"
everything together.
BILKINS
Then what happened?
BRIAN
I started carrying a badge.
BILKINS

BRIAN

Pearce scoops up one little duffel bag and starts to walk
toward them. Then he goes back and checks the locks again.
BILKINS
You busted your friend?

BRIAN

BILKINS
(shaking his head) This just keeps getting better and
better.
25
"Finally, Pearce makes his way to the car and climbs sullenly"
into the back seat.
BRIAN
"You ready to roll again with me,"
Rome?
PEARCE
"Go to hell, Brian."
The car takes off.
EXT. NONDESCRIPT GARAGE - DAY
Bilkins' car skids to a stop in front of a nondescript
corrugated garage.
"In the back seat, Pearce is scratching his ankle. for the"
"first time, we notice the ankle bracelet is gone."
"Bilkins, Brian and Pearce get out and head for the door."

At the last second Pearce stops. Bilkins and Brian turn and
"look at him, but he doesn't say anything."
BRIAN
(to Bilkins)
Go on in.
"Pearce looks at the building, but his thoughts are somewhere"
else.
BRIAN (cont'd) What's up?
PEARCE
What the hell am I doing here? I
don't know any of these dudes and I

BRIAN
You've been given a second chance
and you're taking it. You don't
"want it, go back to the desert."

"Brian walks off into the garage, leaving Pearce to watch him *"
go. Pearce makes up his mind and follows into the... *
INT. FBI GARAGE - DAY 60
"This garage is sterile, gleaming with equipment."
"Surveillance cameras and monitors are everywhere, but"
invisible from the outside. Covers blanket a couple of cars.
Bilkins stands across from the boys as Markham approaches.
MARKHAM
"Roman Pearce, huh?"
He looks at Pearce's ankle.
MARKHAM (cont'd)
Good to see you got that dog collar
off.
Pearce's eyes narrow.
"Just then, a brown UPS truck pulls up and Monica Clemente"
jumps out of the back. She's wearing a big hat and
"sunglasses, making her hard to recognize. She takes off the"
"glasses and hat, shakes her hair out."
The UPS DRIVER is actually Agent Dunn. He's not at all happy
about his new responsibilities.
BILKINS
(to Dunn)
Any problems?
Dunn shakes his head.
AGENT DUNN
Dry cleaned.
BRIAN
Your tail or that uniform?
AGENT MARKHAM
Keep it up O'Connor. They'd love
to have your ass sent back to L.A.
Pearce looks at Brian.
AGENT MARKHAM (cont'd)
(to Pearce)
Your friend here was undercover and
let his man go.

Brian's about to say something but Clemente jumps in.
CLEMENTE
(checking her watch)
"We've got about five minutes, so"
let's get going.
BILKINS
"Brian O'Connor, Roman Pearce, I"
want you to meet Monica Clemente.
He shakes her hand.
BRIAN
I've seen you at the races.
CLEMENTE
Good for you.
"(to Bilkins, without"
missing a beat)
Do they have background on Verone?
Bilkins nods.
"CLEMENTE (cont'd) Good, here's the deal. Verone's"
looking for drivers. He's put me
in charge of finding them.
She examines the both of them.
CLEMENTE (cont'd)
"You're going to be tested, but I"
don't know how. I had to bring in
some other bandits to make it look
"legit, so it's up to you to win his"
trust.
PEARCE
When do we meet him?
CLEMENTE
Now.

Dunn and Markham move over and pull the covers off the cars: *
a bright orange MITSUBISHI EVO and a blue MITSUBISHI SPYDER.
The boys slide into the cars; Clemente jumps in with Brian.
BILKINS
You guys check in with us after
your meeting.
(MORE}

BILKINS (cont'd)
We'll be at the Cuban sandwich shop
by you~ houseboat.
CLEMENTE
Let's get going. My car's in a
garage downtown.
"Brian and Pearce start the engines, then roar out."
EXT. STREET #3 - DAY

Brian drives Clemente in the EVO while Pearce tails behind in
the Spyder.
They roll down the streets of Miami. BIKINI BABES and LOCAL
KIDS gawk at the rides.
EXT./INT. STREET #4/BRIAN'S EVO - DAY
CLEMENTE
Turn here.
62
Brian does and the scenery quickly turns darker. A part of
Miami they don't put in the brochures.
Brian manages a glance her way.
BRIAN
You don't look like a Fed.
CLEMENTE
That's the idea.
BRIAN
How long've you been under?
CLEMENTE
(smiles)
I lost track.
BRIAN
It hasn't caught up with you?
CLEMENTE
"Hey, I'm livin' the life, doin'"
what I have tot' survive.
BRIAN

CLEMENTE
(confident)
I got it all figured out. Don't
worry about me.

EXT. RUN-DOWN WAREHOUSE - DAY
A run-down building stands out on the left.
CLEMENTE
Here we go. My car's in the
warehouse over there.

Brian pulls up next to the building and Clemente hops out.
She walks to her car as Pearce pulls up. They both watch her
"go, then Brian notices Pearce eyeing him."
PEARCE
"Don't even think about it, bruh."
"Brian ignores him, sneaks another look at Clemente climbing"
into her car.
INT. FBI SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 64
Markham walks through a hallway and walks into a small room.
The room is filled with surveillance equipment and a TECH
sits in front of a monitor.
MARKHAM
You got 'em?
The tech points at the screen. Two blips sitting in the
middle of Miami.
TECH
Crystal clear. They're just
leaving the parking garage.
MARKHAM
Bilkins lost his mind bringin' on
these two delinquents. I'll bet
you a c-note they run first chance
they get.
TECH
(agreeing)
There aren't odds big enough for me
to take that bet.
Markham starts to leave.
MARKHAM
"You see anything, you call."
BACK TO:

EXT. I-95 - DAY 65
"Pearce and Brian drive up I-95, following Clemente's Mercedes"
"SL 500. At the North Miami Beach exit, they get off,"
EXT. VERONE'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
"navigate a nice ~eighborhood, and pull into a gated drive."
EXT. VERONE'S MANSION - DAY
"The gate swings open, and Clemente leads Brian's EVO and"
Pearce's Spyder up the drive.
Brian and Pearce's cars are side by side and they talk to
each other on the way up the drive.
BRIAN
(to Pearce)
Just keep your mouth shut and
follow my lead.
PEARCE
I got this.
BRIAN
I'm serious now.
PEARCE
"You handle your business, I'll"
handle mine.
"The cars pull up to the front of a Miami palace, probably"
"last owned by Scarface, and the three get out."
"As they step up the steps, the doors open and the one and"
only CARTER VERONE comes out with a beautiful WOMAN.

Clemente takes one look at the woman and cocks her head. She
"actually looks jealous for a second, then brushes it away."
The woman climbs in a BMW and drives off.
Verone is wearing threads that look like they belong on a
"runway in Milan. He's tan, athletic, and has deep-set eyes"
that pierce like rusty nails.
Clemente watches the woman's car drive off.
CLEMENTE
"Business meeting, Carter?"
VERONE
Always. You know me.

He plants a kiss on her cheek. Pearce can't help but notice *
the jealousy on Clemente's face. *

VERONE (cont'd) Where'd you boys come from?
CLEMENTE
They're street racers. I found 'em
racing laps down South Side. They
were the best.
VERONE
We'll find out soon enough.
"ROBERTO, a goon that works for Verone, walks up and whispers"
something in Clemente's ear.
CLEMENTE
(to Verone}
You ready for the others?
VERONE
What'd I come out here for?
Roberto speaks into a radio.

for speed.
DRIVERS emerge from behind the various machines. A second
"goon, Enrique, walks up behind them. He and Roberto watch *"
the drivers from both sides.
Verone tilts his head as Enrique and Roberto converge. They *
"slowly circle Pearce, eyeing him and Brian. Both Pearce and"
Brian stare right back.
ROBERTO
"(in Spanish, to Brian}"
Pretty boy. *
BRIAN
(back in Spanish)
Ugly fucker. *
Roberto's face turns into a sneer.
VERONE
Enough.
Verone moves between his goons and the men.
PEARCE
(to Brian) What'd he say?
BRIAN
He said you were ugly.

"Pearce isn't sure how to take this, but Verone is already"
addressing the gathering.
VERONE
"Two weeks ago, my Ferrari was towed"
and sits at an impound lot in
Little Haiti. That's about twenty
miles from here.
Verone smiles.
VERONE (cont'd)
"Now, I could give two shits about"
the car. I can buy ten of 'em on
my debit card. What I do care
about is the pearl ring I left in
the glove box. My mother gave me
that ring when I turned sixteen.
He walks amongst the drivers.
VERONE (cont'd) So we're gonna see if you're the
kind of drivers Clemente here says
you are.
The drivers check each other out. Nothing but criminal
faces.
VERONE (cont'd) The first team back here with my
"ring gets to work a job for me,"
which means.more money than you've
ever seen.
(beat)
The rest of you can wonder what you
missed out on.
"One driver, OLAN, looks pissed."
OLAN
You telling us we gotta audition?
VERONE
Nobody's putting a gun to your head.

"The driver's all LAUGH, if not a little nervously. No one's"
about to back down.
VERONE (cont'd)
Good. Now leave your driver's
licenses and we'll get started.
"Pearce and Brian, along with the rest, fish out their"
"wallets, hand their licenses to Clemente."
IN THE DRIVE:

EXT. I-95 - DAY 68
The race cars rip up an on-ramp and launch on to the highway.
"Brian and Pearce drive lights out, weaving in and out of"
"traffic, just blurs on the highway. Right behind them, the"
other six drivers snake through the traffic.
EXT. VERONE'S MANSION - DAY 69
Verone puts his hand out and Clemente hands him the licenses.
"He carries them, followed by Clemente, into his house."
INT. VERONE'S ENTRYWAY - DAY 69A *
"Coming down a large staircase in VERONE'S MOM, a happy Cuban *"
woman. She smiles when she sees Clemente. *
VERONE ' S MOM *
Monica! *
CLEMENTE *

VERONE ' S MOM *
When are you gonna call me Mama *
like I said? *
CLEMENTE *
"Sorry, Mama. *"
The two woman hug like they're family. *
VERONE *
"Mom, go on out to the pool. We're"
almost done here. *
*
His mom nods and smiles at Clemente as she heads out back. *

INT. VERONE'S CORRIDOR & OFFICE - DAY 70 *
Verone and Clemente step down a corridor... *

little table. He stands quickly.
WHITWORTH
"(to Verone, nervously)"
Are we through?
VERONE
I don't know. Are we?
WHITWORTH

"Affairs sniffing at my door,"

Verone just moves on past him without stopping.
VERONE
Then I guess we're through.
The detective looks uneasy and moves away.
"Verone continues on to a fully-furnished home office, where a"
Puerto Rican WHIZ-KID sits at a computer.
Verone hands the licenses to the guy.
starts typing away at his keyboard.
Verone's face.
CLEMENTE
He wheels around and
Clemente gets in
So who was the woman in the Beemer?
VERONE
No one.
CLEMENTE
Don't give me that.
EXT. I-95 - DAY
BACK TO:
71
Brian is leading Pearce into a group of 18-wheelers. One
"truck is about to catch another, and once it does, the boys"
will be blocked behind the big rigs. Just as Brian is about
"to pass the second truck and cut in front of it, Pearce drops"
"the hammer and races in front of him, cutting Brian off."
Brian has to hit the brakes.

Pearce smiles in his rearview mirror.
Brian is not to be outdone. *
BRIAN *
"Not bad, Rome. *"
"Brian guns it and shoots the g0p between the two trucks, *"
"creating his own lane, barely giving inches on either side."
"As he passes Pearce, Brien puts his cg into e 180 degree *"
"slide so he's looking face to face with Pearce for a moment, *"
"smiling, his middle finger flying. *"
Brian spins around and continues on. *
PEARCE *
Show off. *
"It's on, and Pearce races after Brian. *"
One of the Vipors tries to pull the same feat through the *
"trucks, but gets bumped by one of the big rigs. He bounces *"
"off both of them like a pinball and spins out, knocking his"
driving partner out of commission.
The rest of the cars swerve around the damage and haul ass
after Brian and Pearce.
INT. BRIAN'S EVO - DAY 72
"The CAMERA FINDS a wire under the steering column, traces it"


EXT. I-95 - EVO ZOOM TO SATELLITE - DAY
"The CAMERA SHOOTS UP from the car, in two seconds ripping through the atmosphere,"
EXT. SPACE - DAY
"up to space, BAM!, where it bounces off a satellite and"
"rockets back down to Earth, Florida, Miami,"
EXT. FBI - ROOFTOP - DAY
"and BAM! rips through the roof of a building, finally stopping at a computer station."

INT. FBI SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
"The tech monitoring the blips looks at his screen, almost"

INT. FBI - WAR ROOM - DAY

"Markham answers his ringing cell phone, listens for a second,"
then hangs up. He nods at Dunn and the two quietly slip out.
EXT. FBI BLDG. - DAY

AGENT MARKHAM
I knew they'd run. Let's bag 'em.
They jump into a sedan parked at the curb and take off.


"Pearce and Brian spot the LITTLE HAITI exit, Pearce leading"
the way.
Brian downshifts and cranks the wheel. His tires catch and
he races down the off-ramp after Pearce.
EXT. I-95 SIDE STREET - DAY
"They barrel down a side street, turning heads from the"
immigrants sitting out in the sun.
EXT. I-95 - DAY

"Back on the highway, the four remaining drivers stream off"
the highway and take the exit from various angles. An Audi
smacks into a dark Mercedes. The Mercedes swerves but
regains control and maintains the chase.
INT. VERONE'S OFFICE - DAY
Verone and Clemente are still on each other.
CLEMENTE
"I'll take care of your business,"
"find you drivers, whatever. But"
what I won't do is share you. Comprende?
VERONE
(smiling)
Si. Si.

He moves over an~ puts his arms around her.
VERONE (cont'd)
That's why I like you so much.
You're the only one who will talk
to me like that.
"He plants one on her and she kisses him back, placated."

"At the computer, Brian's file comes up on the screen."
Juvey record for popping cars. Two years in JD. Then
another year for aiding and abetting an armed robbery. He
sure looks like a bad egg.
WHIZ-KID
"Your street racer is clean. Dirty,"
but clean.
Verone takes a look at the screen.
VERONE
And his partner?

EXT. FBI LOT - DAY 83
Pearce's Spyder busts through a chain link gate guarding the
"property, Brian's EVO right behind him."
"A SECURITY GUARD in a little hut can't believe his eyes,"
these two cars crashing through the gate.
IN PEARCE'S SPYDER:
Both Pearce and Brian's eyes scan the lot like hawks. The
"lot is filled with yachts, jet-skis and cigarette boats all"
"in impound. They are all randomly placed, and the two cars"
have to dodge the parked vehicles like two rats in a maze.
They race around a corner and zero in on a cherry red Ferrari
parked in the corner. Pearce puts the car in a spin and
races for Verone's sweet ride.
IN THE LOT:
"Pearce and Brian zip their cars into a slide and park side by side, both jumping out at the same time."
"They walk quickly over to the passenger window, Pearce"
pulling off his shirt on the way.

"Without breaking stride, Pearce wraps the shirt around his"
"fist, pulls his arm back, and let's one fly into the window."
SHATTERING it.
"As Pearce pulls his arm back, Brian just reaches over and"
opens the door. It was unlocked.
"Not wasting any more time, Brian pops open the glove box."
"Sure enough, a single pearl ring waits. Brian yanks it out,"
looks at Pearce.
BRIAN
You can put your shirt back on.
IN THE LOT:
"At the gate, the other drivers roar on to the lot. Olan"
picks up his radio and barks at his partner.
OLAN
Don't let 'em leave with that ring.
INT. VERONE'S OFFICE - DAY
Pearce's file comes up on the screen. Verone studies it
intently.

A rap sheet that looks like a laundry list: reckless
"endangerment, armed robbery, smuggling, 3 years in the joint."
EXT. FBI LOT - DAY
Just as Brian and Pearce are hurrying back to their

AT THE GUARD HOUSE:

"The security guard has a phone to his ear, about to phone in"
"the breach, when Markham's dark sedan flies on to the lot,"
peels out toward the Ferrari.
Olan catches it in his rearview.
OLAN
(into his radio) Shit. Feds.


AT THE END OF THE LOT:
"Pearce and Brian have reached their care, but they both pause"
to look up at Markham and Dunn approaching in a cloud of

Pearce and Brian exchange a concerned look. Pearce untucke a
"Colt from his belt, just as Markham steps out of the sedan."
MARKHAM
(calls out)

"But before he can say more, Pearce raises the pistol .ang_ FIRES a shot into Markham's leg."
"Markham drops, howling."
OLAN
Christ! He shot a Fed.
Brian and Pearce jump back in their rides and tear out of
there.
The other four drivers throw their cars into gear and try to
"cut off Brian's EVO, but he uses the impounded cars as"
blockers and steers the EVO out of the lot.
EXT. I-95 - ACCESS ROAD - DAY
"Pearce and Brian lead the way back toward the highway, but"
the two Audie stay right on their asses.
Austin Thomas sets his sights on Brian's EVO.
AUSTIN
(thick German accent)
The one in the EVO has the ring.
"Just then, Brian looks over at Pearce."
PEARCE
Time for me to do what I do best.

Pearce slams on his brakes. The two Audi's spin out in both
"directions to avoid him, taking out the other cars and flying off the pavement."
"Pearce smiles as up ahead, Brian has a clear path to victory."

EXT. VERONE'S MANSION - DAY
Brian SCREECHES up in his car as Verone and Clemente move
down the steps to greet him. Brian emerges and starts
"walking toward Verone, cool as a cucumber."
"Just then, Pearce's Spyder enters with Olan right behind,"
pissed.
Olan calls out to Verone from his window.
OLAN
That crazy asshole shot a Fed!
He tears out of there.

Verone looks at the boys with a newfound appreciation. Brian
"tosses him the ring, not breaking stride for the front door."
Verone looks at the ring in his palm as Pearce passes too.
PEARCE
(cool)
You got anything to eat around
here?
"Verone laughs and smiles at Clemente, happy with his new men."
EXT. VERONE'S - PORCH - DAY 88
"Verone eats ham croquetas, cutting off a piece, then stabbing"
it and eating it off the end of his knife. *
Brian looks over at Clemente who smiles back at him. This
isn't lost on Verone or Pearce. *
VERONE
I have an idea. Why don't you boys
join me tonight at the club? Then
we can all get to know each other a
little better.
CLEMENTE
That's a great idea.
VERONE
Opium at ten.
BRIAN
All right.


PEARCE
"What's.this job all about, anyway?"
"Verone chews on a piece of ham, washes it down with some OJ."
"He turns his eyes on Pearce, stares at him for a long moment."

Verone nods at the back yard. He stands up and the boys
"follow, but not before Pearce picks up an empenada off his"
plate.
EXT. BACK YARD - VERONE'S MANSION - DAY 88A
They stand in the middle of the yard. Verone signals to
"Enrique, who presses a button on the wall by the house. *"
"Suddenly, NOISY WATER SPRINKLERS start shooting up all around"
"them, but they stand in the perfect spot not to get wet."
VERONE
(re: the sprinklers)
"The house has ears in it, so we"
water the yard when I want to talk.
(beat)
That's why my grass looks so good.
Brian nods. Verone looks at Pearce.
VERONE (cont'd)
(impressed)
You shot a Fed.
BRIAN
Maybe we're just hungrier than
those other guys.
VERONE
Maybe so. Maybe so. But it could
prove sticky for me.
PEARCE
We were gone before they knew what
happened. No one ' s gonna tie us to
you.
"Verone nods, thinking."
VERONE
This job. I have something I want
you to carry from North Beach to
the Keys.
BRIAN
What is it?

Verona's eyes go hard.
VERONE
Let's just say I've had my day and
it's time to relocate. The Feds
are way too close and the local
cops are getting harder and harder
to control. I'll be waiting for
you myself with fifty grand when
you make a successful run.

Pearce and Brian look at each other. Pearce turns back to
Verone.
PEARCE
"Your pockets ain't nervous, but"
ours are empty. Make it fifty gees
apiece and we'll drive whatever you

Verone stares at him. Pearce nonchalantly pops a piece of
empenada in his mouth.
PEARCE {cont'd)
"Like he said, we're hungry."
EXT. VERONE'S MANSION - DAY
The boys walk across Verona's drive to their cars.
BRIAN
I said to let me talk.
PEARCE
Looks to me like you wanna do a
little more than that.
BRIAN
What's that mean?
PEARCE
"Stay away from her, Bri. She's too"
tight with Verone for this to be
all business.
BRIAN
Naw. She's just doing her job.
PEARCE
Like you in L.A.?
Brian changes the subject.

BRIAN
Where'd you get the gun anyway?
PEARCE
"Hey, a brother can always find a"
"piece. Shit, you packin' too."
"He flips up Brian's shirt, and Brian's got a gun too."
PEARCE (cont'd)
That's my boy. So what you think
we're carrying?
BRIAN
Cash. Drug money he can't get
outta the country.
"They keep walking, Brian thinking."
BRIAN (cont'd)
How did Markham know where to find
us?

"Brian looks at the cars, then climbs into his car and finds"
the wire running under the steering column.
BRIAN (cont'd) They got us wired.
PEARCE
So yank that shit outta there.
Brian thinks for a second.
EXT. EDWIN'S GARAGE - DAY 90
The boys roll up to a marina. The lot looks like a gum-ball
"machine, street cars of every color jammed in. They drive"
through to a short gravel road leading to what looks like a
run-down wooden building.
EDWIN'S GARAGE
"The 40 year-old sign on the top reads ""Mercury outboards"" in"
faded letters.
EXT. EDWIN'S BEACH - DAY
They park and walk toward a small beach behind the garage.
"Kids of all shapes and sizes hang out. Volleyball,"


"In the water, ten boats tied side by side float lazily. Kids"
"lay on them, dive off them into the blue water, or socialize"
from boat to boat.
Brian and Pearce walk through the sand.
PEARCE
"Man, Miami's so hot and humid I"
can't even wear no drawers!
Pearce catches the eye of a group of bikini-wearing GIRLS.
He smiles and they all smile back.
PEARCE (cont'd)
But it's got a whole lot of
potential.
They reach an old dock sticking out into the water.
"Edwin sits under an umbrella at the end of the dock, Suki in"
his lap.

PEARCE {cont'd)
What the hell are they doing?
EDWIN

Making me money.
"A trio of JET-SKIS rip around a turn, racing a lap in the *"
water.
EDWIN (cont'd) (to the crowd)
"Raymond is even money, Marco's four"
"to one and Goodwin, hell you'd be"
throwing your money away if you bet
"on him. come on now, give it up."
Let me see some jack!
Kids start handing him money and placing their bets. Edwin
writes in a notebook as fast as he can.
"The jet-skis race by the dock, spraying water everywhere. *"
Brian steps up. *
BRIAN
Edwin Bishop meet Roman Pearce.
Edwin and Pearce bump fists.

EDWIN
"What's.up, man?"
PEARCE
What's up?
BRIAN
You mind if he flops here?
EDWIN
"Course not. Show him around, I'll"
be right up.
EXT. EDWIN'S GARAGE - DAY
"Brian shows Pearce a cot in a corner, a flimsy straw"
partition separates the cot from the rest of the room.
BRIAN
Here's your bed.
PEARCE
No problem. I love the smell of
motor oil in the morning.

He tosses his duffel on the bed. The CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM
"around the partition, and we now see what he's talking about."
"It's a long garage, several cars sit in bays being worked on"
by kids.
"Brian and Pearce walk past the cars to the end, where Edwin's"
"mechanic, an Asian dude named JIMMY, is peering at the engine"
of Pearce's car.
BRIAN
"You ever see anything like this,"
Jimmy?
JIMMY
Nope. The other one the same
story?
Brian nods. Jimmy shakes his head.
JIMMY (cont'd)
"The DIS box, the engine management"
"system, hell, the main harness."
The GPS is spidered into all of it.
(MORE)
JIMMY (cont'd)
You rip it outta there and you got
nothin' but a real expensive soap
box derby car. You'd have to swap
the whole engine.

"Frustrated, Brian leans against the car as Edwin and Suki"
stroll up.
EDWIN
Do I even wanna ask where you got
these rides?
BRIAN
No.
EDWIN
"All right, that's cool. Just as"
long as you run with 'em one of
these nights. Some serious honey
to be made off these.
Brian looks out the garage door across the beach. He cocks
"his head, like he sees something strange."
BRIAN
We'll figure something out. *
(beat) *
"Thanks, Edwin. We gotta be *"
"somewhere, so we'll catch up with *"
you later. *
EDWIN
"All right, just let me know."
They all bump hands with Pearce and Brian and shuffle back to
the garage.
PEARCE
What is it?
BRIAN
See that Cadillac parked by the
surf shop?
PEARCE
Yeah.
BRIAN
Look closely.
"Pearce focuses in. Sure enough, sitting in the front seat"
"watching them are Verene's goons, Enri@e and Roberto. *"
Pearce shoots another look at Enrique and Roberto. *
94
PEARCE
I'll take care of Frick and Frack.
You be ready to drive.
EXT. EDWIN'S STREET - DAY

Pearce emerges from the garage with a rag in one hand and a
bottle in the other. Enrique and Roberto shift nervously *
when they realize that he's coming over to them.
PEARCE
Elian and Fidel. What's crackin'
with y'all? Clean your windshield
for you?
Enrique says something to Roberto in Spanish.
PEARCE {cont'd)
{talking nonsense)
"Si, si. Muchas igualidad."
"Gracias, senores. Asi, Asi."
Pearce squirts some liquid on their windshield and starts
rubbing it around.
PEARCE (cont'd)
"Damn, you got some big bugs in"
Florida.
"They are muttering to him in Spanish, but he just keeps on"
"squirting and rubbing. Finally, they get out of the car to"
challenge Pearce.
"Like a flash, Pearce has a lit zippo in his hand."
PEARCE (cont'd)
(serious now)
What y'all gonna do?
Enrique and Roberto just stand there.
PEARCE (cont'd)
"Yeah, right."
And he tosses the lighter on the car. FLAMES burst from the

"windshield, and we see now the bottle he had was of lighter *"
fluid ..
"Before the goons can do anything, Brian races up, Pearce"
"jumps in, and they are gone .."

INT. SANDWICH SHOP - DAY 95
Brian and Pearce step inside to find Bilkins sitting at a
"table, a big sandwich in front of him. The only other people"
in here are old Cuban men playing dominos in the corner.
"Through the glass door, they can see Markham and Dunn on the"
"patio. Markham is on crutches, his leg in a full cast,"
looking like he wants to kill someone.
BILKINS
What the hell're you trying to
"pull, Pearce?"
PEARCE
(innocently)
What?
BILKINS
What? You put Markham on crutches
for six weeks!
PEARCE
You didn't think Verone was gonna
let us inside without putting us to
"a test, did you1 I had to do"
something to convince him we were
legit!
"Before Bilkins can answer, Pearce takes half his sandwich and"
digs in.
BRIAN
What the hell was Markham doing there anyway?
BILKINS
He thought you were running.
BRIAN
He could've blown the whole thing.
"Bilkins takes a moment, blows out a breath."
BILKINS
They want to string you guys up.
BRIAN
"Keep 'em off us, Bilkins. You're"
"the big boss, aren't you?"
BILKINS
Give me a reason to.

BRIAN
Verone slipped up and said he'd be
at the drop waiting for us. Has he
ever done that before?
BILKINS
Not that we've been able to
witness.
BRIAN
Something's got him spooked. He
said he didn't trust the local cops
even though he's got 'em on the
payroll.
BILKINS
(seeing it)
"Yeah, yeah."
BRIAN
"I'll bet my life he's pulling out,"
which is why he'll risk being there
himself.
BILKINS
So how you wanna play this?
BRIAN
We're meeting him tonight at some
"club. Beyond that, he just said be"
ready to drive.
BILKINS
Okay. Everything looks good.
PEARCE
Not everything. Clemente's head
ain't on right.
BILKINS
How so?
PEARCE
You should see how she looks at
Verone.
BRIAN
Naw. She's okay.
Bilkins looks at them both.

BILKINS
All right. We' 11 watch her. Meet
"him tonight, and we'll go from"
there.
50
"Brian and Pearce stand up and head out, but not before Pearce"
takes the rest of Bilkins' sandwich.
EXT. SANDWICH SHOP - DAY
"They climb into their car and before they can pull away,"
there is a TAP on the driver's side glass.
Markham and Dunn are standing there. Markham with his
crutches. Brian rolls down his window.
MARKHAM
One more thing Bilkins may not've
told you. You don't ~ollar Verone
and I will personally bring you

96
"He's in mid-sentence, when Brian steps on the gas, reversing"
out of there and nearly knocking him over.
IN BRIAN'S CAR:
Brian watches the pissed off Markham get smaller and smaller.
BRIAN
I gotta ask you something.
PEARCE
Shoot.
BRIAN
Why do you eat so much?
He pops a bit of sandwich into his mouth.
PEARCE
I been on the inside and I know how
shitty the grub is. The way things
are setting up here it's just a
matter of time before I'm back
there again. I'm gonna eat all I
can while I still can.
(beat)
Plus they tell me I got a high
metabolism.
BRIAN
You're not going back in.

PEARCE
Tell me why. We got Markham

"saddling up on Verone, and we got"
two cars that're no better'n my
ankle bracelet ..
Brian looks at him.
PEARCE (cont'd)
"So I was thinking... Jimmy, this"
grease-monkey .. He's good?
BRIAN
The best.
PEARCE
And Edwin. Think he can get us in
a race for slips?
Brian eyes Pearce. A smile breaks across his face.
BRIAN

PEARCE
"(smiling, repeats) Yeah, we need two more cars."
EXT. PINK SLIP - START AREA - NIGHT
"Edwin limps purposefully, a radio to his ear."
EDWIN
"Team one, team two, I need a report back, chop-chop."

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an even bigger CROWD than was
"evident in the opening scene. More cars, more kids, more of"
the most beautiful women Miami has to offer. There's an
energy that can't be found anywhere else in the world except
on a race night.
"Motorcycles do tricks up and down the street, entertaining"
the crowd.
"Brian walks up to Edwin, bumps fists."
BRIAN
Thanks for setting this up.

EDWIN
Are you kidding? When I put out
"word that you wanted to race tagteam for slips, I might as well've"
said I was down here just handing
out the loochie. Everyone and
their mama came out to see it.

"He points over to Slap-Jack, standing next to his MAMA, who"
also looks just like him.
PEARCE
How come you don't run?
Edwin raps his bum-leg with his fist.
EDWIN
I hit a wall at a buck-twenty back
in L.A. Came home here to get well
and been fine just organizing and
collecting. I got Brian to join me
and we been Shaq and Kobe ever
since.
BRIAN
Edwin used to kill when he was
rollin' on the West Coast.
PEARCE
(to Edwin) Maybe you should get back up on
"that horse again, bruh."

EDWIN
"All right, here's your choices."
He points to a pair of Eurotrash guys leaning next to a pair *
of American cars. *
EDWIN (cont'd)
You got Mathias and Jean-Claude and *
their American muscle.

EDWIN (cont'd)
Or you got Flip and Samuel and
their twin Toyotas.
"Two black guys stand by their rides, listening to some"
Southern-style rap music.


EDWIN (cont'd)
Or there's Koto and Livan holding *
down the sweet pair of Japanese
fire.
"He points over to an Asian guy, KOTO, and his Cuban friend, *"
"LIVAN, standing next to their rides, Cuban hip-hop music *"
blaring from speakers. The cars are an ACURA NSX and a HONDA *
2000. *
Brian checks out the rides. The Honda 2000 has SUICIDE
"DOORS, doors with hinges on the back of the door rather than"
the front. Brian nods at Edwin. The three of them move over
to the guys.
EDWIN (cont'd)
"Koto and Livan, this is Brian"
O'Conner and Roman Pearce. You're
gonna race tonight.

The competitors bump fists. Livan whispers something to *
Koto.
KOTO
He's Bullitt?
PEARCE
(smiling)
Bullitt? Who's Bullitt?
Livan points at Brian.
PEARCE (cont'd)
You think he's Steve McQueen?
(laughing)
That's what you got these folks
down here calling you? Bullitt?
This is too funny to Pearce. Edwin keeps trying to broker
the deal.
EDWIN
"C'mon Livan, he ain't all that"
fast.
BRIAN
How bout we make a deal? No
nitrous for Pearce here.
Pearce stops laughing.

PEARCE
What?

LIVAN
"He hits the bottle, we get the"
cars?
BRIAN
That's the deal.
KOTO
You got yourself a race.
They walk off as Pearce pushes Brian.
PEARCE
What'd you have to kill my spray
for?
EXT. PINK SLIP - NORTH COURSE STREET #1 - NIGHT

"The pick-up trucks unload their ""STREET CLOSED"" signs up and"
EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE SIDE STREET - NIGHT
down the warehouse district.
EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT

Pearce's Spyder and Livan's Acura sit side by side pointing *
out an alley.
Pointing out the opposite side of this small alley are
Brian's EVO and Koto's Honda. *
EDWIN
Here's the deal. Another Edwin
Bishop masterpiece if I do say so
myself. First wave cars have to
"complete the North course, all left"
"turns, wrapping up with the tunnel"
on Canal street. The tunnel only
has enough room for one car at a
"time, so whoever gets there first"
is gonna win the lap.
He points to the tunnel to his right.
EDWIN (cont'd)
Which'll bring them swinging back
"by this alley, going this way."
"He points to his.left, looks at Brian and Koto."
EDWIN (cont'd)
You two can't take off until your
"partner passes behind you. If you jump, you lose."
Brian and Koto nod.
EDWIN (cont'd) Then you gotta take the opposite
"course, the South course, all left"
"turns, finishing with the bridge"
off Dunes.

"The crowd surrounding Edwin, about to watch this race, can't"
"believe the rules. They're beside themselves, throwing out"
"""Oh, shit""s and ""For real""s."
EDWIN {cont'd)

"lap starts, we're gonna throw the"
"Dunes bridge and this time,~"
ain't gonna stop it1
He uses his hands as a visual.
EDWIN (cont'd)
If the racers don't reach the
bridge before the angle gets too
"high, then you gonna have to brake"

"gonna cross the finish line, and"

"Even louder ""Oh, shit""s from the crowd. They've never heard"
of such a race.
EDWIN {cont'd)
"All right, then. Let's give 'em"
something to smile about.
He raises his hands.
EDWIN {cont'd) Ready!

Pearce and Livan gun their engines. The crowd backs out of *
"the way, lining up and down the street."
Edwin drops his hands and BAM! fearce and Liyan rip out of
the starting blocks. *


Livan has a monster under his hood -- his Acura blitzes out *
"of the gates, zero to off-the-charts in two seconds flat. He"
and Pearce are neck and neck.
EXT. PINK SLIP - NORTH COURSE STREET #1 - NIGHT 101
"Pearce anticipates the first turn, spins the wheel, pumps his"
brake and just cuts in front of the Acura as they head down
the straightaway.
There isn't much room for error on these narrow streets.
"Pearce's got the gas to the floorboard, but can't seem to"
gain too much of a lead.


He puts his thumb back on the wheel and stays on course.
EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT 102
"Brian and Koto sit in their rides, side by side, both with *"
"eyes glued to their rear view mirrors, waiting for that flash"
of color that is going to let them punch it on to the South
Course.
Raymond and Marco from the inner-tubes stand in front of the
"cars, holding flags."
EXT. PINK SLIP - NORTH COURSE STREET #2 - NIGHT 103
"Again, Pearce's Spyder whips left and disappears from Livan's *"
sight.
"Livan throws everything he has into the next left turn, and *"
spots Pearce heading for the tunnel.
LIVAN *
(grinning)
Not fast enough.
His finger pops the nitrous button and his Acura rockets for
the tunnel.
IN THE Spyder:
Pearce can't do a damn thing as the Acura passes him in a
"blaze, narrowly cutting him off before he hits the tunnel."
PEARCE
Whoa!

EXT. PINK SLIP - NORTH COURSE - TUNNEL - NIGHT 104
"The front of Pearce's car gets clipped as the Acura goes by,"
and he fights the wheel as he enters the tunnel doing well
over a buck-twenty.
IN THE TUNNEL:

"it looks like he's a dead man, for sure. But the back tires"
"catch the pavement again, and even Pearce can't believe he"
survived.
"He guns it, having lost some valuable time."
EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT 105
Livan's Acura exits the tunnel in a blur and crosses past the *
"alley. At the same time, Koto spots it in his rearview and *"
Raymond in front throws the flag and dashes out of the way.
Koto's Honda ROARS out of there on to the South course. *
"Brian's flag man stays in front of the car, watching intently."
INT. PINK SLIP - BRIDGE CONTROL HUT - NIGHT 106
"A kid throws the ""Lift"" button and the bridge begins to rise."
EXT. PINK SLIP - AIRBORN - NIGHT 107
An aerial view shows the dimensions of the two different
"courses, which resembles two squares touching at one diagonal"
point.
We can see Pearce's Spyder bursting from the tunnel of the
"North Course, and Koto's Honda launching out on to the South *"
Course.
EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT 108
"Brian has his eyes closed, sitting placidly in his car. The"
black kid with the flag can't believe it.
EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT 109
Pearce flies out of the tunnel and ROARS for the finish line.


EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT 110
At the exact moment that Pearce's car passes in the rear
"view, Brian's eyes pop open and he immediately floors the"
"EVO, the Marco with the flag literally diving out of the way"
as the beast roars after the Honda.
"Just as Brian gets the EVO up to full speed, Koto's Honda *"
disappears around the first turn.
EXT. PINK SLIP - AIRBORN - NIGHT 111
The crowd that had gathered to watch the finish of the North
Course now races down the alleys to watch the finish of the
South Course.
EXT. PINK SLIP - ALLEY - NIGHT 112
Pearce leaps out of his Spyder and sprints ahead to join the
crowd.
EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE - DUNES BRIDGE - NIGHT 113
The bridge continues to make a sharper incline than the last

EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE STREET #1 - NIGHT 114
"Brian is a freaking force behind the wheel, the only giveaway that he's pressing it: the flexing of the muscles in his jaw."
"He gains on the Honda, racing the EVO full out."
KOTO'S POV: *
Koto has one eye on the turn up ahead and one eye on the fast *
approaching EVO in his rear-view.
The smile that was on his face disappears.
EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE STREET #2 - NIGHT
"Brian watches the Honda whip around the second turn, and"


"This time he's already turning the wheel, skidding the car so"
"that he takes the turn on the short side, saving ground and"
getting back into full speed without giving anything away.
"He's nearly on to~ 2t the Honda, having closed the distance"
like A.J. Foyt in the 500.

EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE - SIDE STREET - NIGHT 116
"A BUSINESSMAN in an SUV looks at the ""STREET CLOSED"" sign,"
but doesn't really see any reason for the street to be
closed.
"He looks again, stumped, then throws on his turn blinker. A"
few more overly-cautious looks and he drives out past the
"sign, on to the road. Very slowly and carefully."
EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE STREET #3 - NIGHT 117
Brian stays right on the tail of the Honda as they approach
the third turn that will lead to the finish line. Brian
"ducks inside, looking to pass on the narrow street."
"But in the turn, Koto cuts him off, leaving Brian a length *"
behind.
EXT. PINK SLIP - BRIDGE STREET - NIGHT
SUV DRIVER:
"White knuckles at 10 and 2, this guy won't get his car up"
past 15mph.
118

"suv is straight ahead of them on this narrow street, slowing for the bridge that is starting to climb perilously high."
SUV DRIVER POV:
"He does a doubletake, spying these beasts approaching in his"
rear-view mirror.
ON THE STREET:
"Brian is desperate, so he yanks the wheel and hits the"
"nitrous, the burst of power rocketing him toward the Honda,"
which gets to the SUV and the bridge first.
"Like precision dancers, the two race cars split just enough"
"to pass within centimeters of the SUV, ripping off both of"
their side-view mirrors.
EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE - DUNES BRIDGE - NIGHT 119
"The Honda hits the jump first, but Brian hits it 40mph"
faster. The result is Brian's car passing directly over the
Honda in mid-air!

EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE - FINISH LINE - NIGHT
"The crowd gasps, watching these cars soar over the canal."
Pearce holds his breath.
EXT. PINK SLIP - SOUTH COURSE - DUNES BRIDGE - NIGHT

"Brian's EVO lands in front of Koto's Honda, but the extra *"
speed and height cause the EVO to come down hard on its front
"tires, and it hops up like a rabbit."
"Brian's car fishtails, and he desperately works the wheel to"
keep the car from sliding into the giant crowd.
EXT. PINK SLIP - FINISH AREA - NIGHT 122
"With one last yank of the wheel, he slides across the finish"
"line sideways, but still a length ahead of the Honda."
EXT. PINK SLIP - FINISH AREA - NIGHT 123
"Pearce can only grin at Brian's skills. Livan falls down, *"
"clutching his heart, playing like this is all too much."
Brian's car stops and he is swarmed by the crowd. Pearce
"walks up and for the first time, they embrace each other like"
brothers.
PEARCE
Nice driving.
BRIAN
You too. You kept it close with
one hand tied behind your back.
"The crowds start to leave, everyone blown away by the close"
race. Brian is catching love from every kid that came down
"to watch. After a moment, he finds Edwin."
BRIAN (cont'd) (to Edwin)
You wanna get those to the garage?
Pearce and I gotta hit it.
EDWIN
"No problem. Yo Suki, help me roll"
these outta here.
Suki nods and she and Edwin drive off in the new rides.

BRIAN
(to Pearce)
You ready to hit this party?
EXT. STREET #4 - NIGHT

Pearce's Spyder and Brian's EVO slip down the street like an
"uncoiled cobra, make a turn and disappear."
EXT. OPIUM - NIGHT 125
"Opium is a dark, cool bar in downtown Miami. The two cars"
"drive up and park, VALET eyes going wide."
INT. OPIUM - NIGHT 126
"It's mellow inside, with a cool vibe. Crushed velour couches"
"are spread around, and dark round booths outline the room."
Brian and Pearce move through the darkness. Clemente greets
"them at the bar, dressed to the nines. She looks damn good."
CLEMENTE
You guys did something right.
Verone never socializes with the
hired help.
BRIAN
Where is he?
CLEMENTE
On his way.
PEARCE
You two don't go everywhere
together?
CLEMENTE
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
bathroom.
PEARCE
I'm gonna find a
"Pearce walks off, leaving them alone."
"Brian scans the room, taking in all the activity, when"
Clemente hands him a beer.
CLEMENTE
So it's true. You think I've
flipped? *
BRIAN
It's not easy being under.
CLEMENTE
It has its highs and lows. You
know that.

Brian looks at her. Is she fucking with him? He's not sure. *
BRIAN
Yeah.
"She takes his hand, gets right in his ear."
CLEMENTE
"Listen to me. I'm working for us,"
okay? I need you to believe me.
"She pulls back, coquettishly."
CLEMENTE (cont'd)
"You believe me, don't you?"
BRIAN
You're pretty good at selling it.
CLEMENTE
It's what I do.
She hasn't released his hand.
"Pearce exits the bathroom, spots the way they're looking at"
"each other as he approaches, and he's not happy about it."
PEARCE

"Brian follows Pearce's gaze to a back booth, where yerone is"
"sitting, watching the whole thing. Clemente quickly drops Brian's hand."
A WAITER appears.
WAITER
Mr. Verone would like for you to
join him.

"Brian, Pearce and Clemente walk though the growing crowd to *"
Verona's booth. Enrique and Roberto stand nearby. *
Pearce just smiles at them.
VERONE
(to his goons)
"Enrique, Roberto. Get some air."
The goons leave as they all pile into the booth.

"Verone puts a finger on Clemente's cheek, follows the line"
down to her neck. He looks at Brian.
VERONE (cont'd)
(to Brian)
You think Monica here is beautiful?
You attracted to her?

BRIAN
"Yeah, she's fine."
Pearce can't believe it. Verone just keeps staring at him.
BRIAN (cont'd)
"In fact, she's gorgeous."
VERONE
"Hold up, cowboy. That's enough."
BRIAN
I'm not gonna lie to you.
VERONE
You wanna sleep with her?

BRIAN
"She's your woman, Carter. You ask"

you yes. You wanna go somewhere
"else with it, don't expect me to"
bite.
Brian leans back.

VERONE
(relaxing)
Women are a powerful force.
He nods at a beautiful BLONDE across the room.

VERONE (cont'd)
See that chick over there. She's
been making eyes at that man all
night.

We see a man sitting with his back to us. We don't see his
face.
"VERONE (cont'd) Five minutes of her time, and she"
can get Mr. Slick to do anything
she wants.
We see the woman stand and walk over to him. She bends over
"and whispers something in his ear, her hand flirtatiously"
touching the back of his neck.
He throws back his drink and the two disappear down a
hallway.
VERONE (cont'd)
See what I mean? Wonder where
they're going.
Verone laughs like this is all too much. Pearce chuckles too
"and Verone immediately turns his eyes on him, stone sober."
VERONE (cont'd) (to Pearce)
You lit my man's car on fire.
PEARCE
Yeah. Sorry about that. I don't
like being followed. And I have a
little issue with authority.
VERONE
"Funny, I have the same thing. For"

That's why I want all of you to
follow me.
"He gets up and the other three look at each other, like"
they're not exactly sure what this guy might pull.
Verone leads them into a dark hallway. Brian and Pearce look
"at each other, trying to decide what to do? Have they been"
made? All they can do is follow.
Verone stops at an unmarked door and walks in.

INT. OPIUM VIP ROOM - NIGHT 127
"The room is empty of people, but decorated lavishly with more"
"couches and tables. Sitting on one table are four items,"
"conspicuous in their placement: a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, a"
"METAL BOX, a ROLL OF DUCT TAPE, and a BLOWTORCH."
The guys eye the objects closely as Verone leads them in.
VERONE
"Have a seat, boys."
Another door opens and Enrique and Roberto enter.
"Verone pours a drink, then rubs his hands together like this"
is getting exciting. The guys can only look at him.

"Just then, the blonde and Detective Whitworth from Verone's *"
"house stumble in, LAUGHING."
Whitworth looks up and sees Verone. The smile quickly disappears from his face.
WHITWORTH *
Carter.
Brian and Pearce look at each other. The man checks the door
"behind him, but Verone's goons now stand in front of it."
"The blonde slinks away, her job done."
VERONE
(to the boys)
"Meet Detective Whitworth, Miami"
P.D.
(to Whitworth)
"Enjoying yourself, Detective?"
WHITWORTH
"(nervously) Yeah, you know me."
Verone walks toward Whitworth.
VERONE
Funny you should say that. I gg know you.
Whitworth spies the items on the table.
VERONE (cont'd)
I know I offered you the deal of a
lifetime and yet you refused.


WHITWORTH
Carter~ I
VERONE
You want to change your mind?
WHITWORTH
Carter
VERONE
Wrong answer.

"Roberto and Enrique grab Whitworth and toss him over a table, *"
on his back. They duct tape his arms and legs down.
WHITWORTH *
"Verone, I'm a police detective. *"
You do anything to me and you'll
bring the entire force down on you *
like a -- *
"Ignoring him, Verone nods at Enrique who rips Whitworth's *"
shirt open. Roberto picks up the blowtorch and fires it up.
WHITWORTH (cont'd) *
"Oh, sweet Christ, Verone! I got *"
Internal Affairs all over mel I *

Verone walks over to the metal box and lifts it up. An ugly brown RAT sits on the table.
Verone grabs the rat by the tail and drops it on Whitworth's
bare stomach. He then covers it with the box.
WHITWORTH (cont'd) What're you doing?
Verone holds the torch against the corner of the metal box.
"In the box, the rat starts SCREECHING, softly at first and"
then louder and louder.
VERONE
"Once this box gets hot enough, that"
rat is gonna want out.
(beat)
And the only direction he can go is
South.
Whitworth struggles to see what's happening.


You know the average rat can chew
through a drain pipe?
67
The box is starting to glow red. The rat keeps SCREECHING
louder.
WHITWORTH
"Jesus Christ, Verone, no!"
VERONE
You're in charge of the cops watching my stash houses. I need a
fifteen minute window where
everyone disappears. Call an
"emergency meeting, have a pancake breakfast, I don't give a damn."
"For that, you'll never have to"
worry about money again.
WHITWORTH

VERONE
I bet it's getting warm in there.

"Whitworth struggles uselessly against the tape, as Enrique *"
"and Roberto smile, amused. The rat is going berserk."
WHITWORTH *
"Okay, okay! I'll do itl *"
VERONE
Say itl
WHITWORTH
I'll give you your window!
"Verone looks at him hard, then moves the torch off the box."
VERONE
"You betray me, my rat is gonna"
"visit your wife, Stacey, your son"
"Clay and your daughter, Lexi. You"
understand me?
"The detective blinks back tears, nodding vigorously."
"Verone turns to Brian and Pearce, sneering, a man not to be"
fucked with.

VERONE {cont'd) The same goes for you two. Be at
"Versailles, six a.m. the day after"
"tomorrow, ready to drive."
68
Enrique opens the back door a crack and lets the rat out into *
the alley.
Verone looks back at Whitworth.
VERONE (cont'd)
"From six-thirty to six-forty-five,"
"your men'll disappear, let my boys"
do their business.
"Whitworth nods, shame-faced."
Verone looks at Clemente.
CLEMENTE

VERONE
"I see you touch another man again,"
I'll kill you. Find your own ride
home.
"Verone walks out, using the blow-torch to light his cigarette"
on the way.
EXT. OPIUM - NIGHT 128
"Shaken, Pearce, Brian and Clemente exit the bar, just in time"
*
to see Verona's black Maserati's taillights roll away. *
CLEMENTE
{nonchalantly)
I'll take a cab to a friend's *
house. *
"Brian starts to speak, but Pearce cuts him off with a look. *"
"Clemente hops in a cab parked at the curb, then leans out the *"
window.
"CLEMENTE (cont'd) That was something, huh?"
"With that, the cab pulls away. Pearce shakes his head at"
"Brian. Slowly, they walk toward the valet."

INT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 129
"It's dark, but there's just enough blue moonlight coming in"
the windows that we can see Brian walk down the small wooden
"steps. He tosses his keys on a table and lets out a long,"
tired breath.
CLEMENTE
Hey.
"Brian spins and sees her sitting on his bed. She stands,"
walks toward him.
"She kisses him, then rips his shirt open. Verone be damned."
"If they're gonna die for this, they're gonna get their"
money's worth. They stumble to the bed.

next to him.

Brian jerks awake. *
PEARCE {cont'd)

the boat. I'll hold 'em up. Get *
her outta here. *
Pearce leaves the little room to go out to the dock. *
CLEMENTE *
Is there a back door? *
BRIAN *
It' s a houseboat. *
"Brian jumps up and looks out the window. Sure enough, *"
Enrique and Roberto are standing at the top of the plank. *

emotion behind it. But then he gives in and hugs her back. *
INT. HOUSEBOAT BATHROOM - DAY 131A
Clemente pulls the door shut and catches a reflection of *
"herself in the mirror. She turns on the faucet, splashes *"
"some water on her face. When she looks in the mirror again, *"
there's an icy resolve.
EXT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 132
Brian joins Pearce outside the boat. *
ROBERTO

past Brian and Pearce.
PEARCE
"Where you goin', Elian?"
INT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 133
Enrique rummages through. The place is small so there aren't *
really any places to hide. He tries to open the door to the
"bathroom, but it's locked, so he rips the door right off the"
hinges.
BATHROOM
But he sees nothing.

"He leaves the bathroom, not even noticing the drain in the"
floor with the hinges on it.
EXT. BRIAN'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 133A
"Enrique comes back out, pissed. As he passes Pearce, Pearce"
just doesn't let it go.
PEARCE
"What's the matter, crackerjack?"
You think you can come up on my
boy's boat like you own the --

"Suddenly, Enrique rams his elbow into Pearce's gut. *"
"Immediately, Pearce straightens up and levels his fist into"
Enrique's jaw. *
"Roberto makes like he's gonna charge Pearce, but Brian puts"
"his shoulder into the heavy, knocking him into the side of"
the dock. They start to throw down.
"In the struggle, Enrique and Roberto go to pull their pistols *"
"at the same time, but in a flash, Brian jerks Roberto's away"
from him.

"lightning, Enrique has a gun at Pearce's head and Brian has a *"
gyn at Roberto's.
Both Brian and Enrique are shouting at each other. *

Nowl I will blow his head hell. You hear me?

VERONE
Enough!
Drop the
Everyone freezes. They look up to see Verone standing on the
"dock, ten feet away."
VERONE (cont'd)
Are you girls finished?

VERONE (cont'd) I'd think before I opened my mouth.

Enrique decides he'd better keep his yap shut. Roberto rises *
to his feet. Brian drops the clip out of Roberto's gun into
"the water, before handing the pistol back to him."
VERONE (cont'd)
I'm glad to see you boys are
getting along so well. Because
"when you drive tomorrow, Enrique *"
and Roberto will be riding along
with you.
Enrique and Roberto smile. *
VERONE (cont'd)
Just to make sure we don't have any
problems.
They start to walk off. Pearce and Brian can't believe it.
This just went from bad to worse.
"Verone stops when he gets to the end of the dock, turns back"
"around, looks right at Brian."

with me. If that's all right with
you.
Verone climbs into his Maserati and roars away. Enrique and *
Roberto follow.
EXT. VERONE'S - POOL - DAY 134

I was at Katie's. There was no way
I was coming back here after last
night.
"He stands in front of her now. He strokes her wet hair,"
smiling.
VERONE
Yeah? And why is your hair wet?
CLEMENTE
I was up early. I went swimming.
VERONE
Swimming? Really? Why don't I
believe you?


CLEMENTE
You don't believe me because you're
a paranoid asshole sometimes.

She pulls away and moves toward the stairs. Something in
Verone's face says he still isn't buying it. He looks out
"the glass door at the small pool house, where the door is"
swinging in the breeze.
EXT. EDWIN'S GARAGE - DAY
Brian and Pearce walk toward the garage.
PEARCE
I'm not gonna end up as shark food

BRIAN
Don't worry about it.
Pearce ain't buying it.
PEARCE
"Yeah, well I am worried. What you"
got going on? Something like this
deal that went down in L.A.?

Brian stops.
BRIAN
"(quietly) Remember us , Rome, growin ' up. Two"
kids playin' in the dirt. Gettin'
in trouble. All that stuff? Well
"you were family to me, man. All I"
had. And I blew it. I put my job

Pearce is taken with Brian's passion.

"In L.A., those guys became my"
family too. And I wasn't gonna make the same mistake again. No
matter what the consequences. So I
let 'em go.

roll up all over the block.

"Watching the scene on the screen, Bilkins at first can't"
process what he is seeing. Then a BROAD SMILE crosses his
face as his eyes try to follow the action on the street.
BILKINS

locals.
(into the radio)
Keep an eye on the GPS.
It's like a giant shell game using import street racing cars
as the shells. There's no way of following which car is
Pearce's and which car is Brian's.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL - STREET #4 - DAY

"Now we see rice rockets up and down the street side-swiping the cops, knocking them off the road, into walls. It's"
payback time for every street racer that's ever had to run


"side by side in a new car, bopping heads to the techno music"
and having the time of their lives.
"The street cars advance forward, engulfing the cops that were"

onto a beach front road.
They dodge and weave through the morning traffic. At a busy
"intersection, the cars each jump a median and race up a"
wooden pier that jets into the ocean.

EXT. KEY'S BRIDGE - SECTION #2 - DAY
"Pearce starts to slow, as does Brian."
Roberto looks out the window at the lamp posts slowly passing.
ROBERTO
Why are we slowing?

He turns back to see Pearce's thumb hanging over what looks
like a temporary nitrous button.
PEARCE
Ejection seat.
The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN to see that the bottom of Roberto's
seat is rigged with nitroua cannistera.
CLOSE UP: PEARCE'S THUMB ON THE BUTTON.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Pearce and Roberto frozen in


BAM! The nitrous cannisters at Roberto's feet EXPLODE like a
couple of MS0's. Enough blast to rip off the hinges of the
suicide door and throw the passenger seat out of the car!

"takes off like a rocket down the bridge, leaving a stunned"
Roberto on the street.

End of the line. *
Brian pushes the same temporary looking ignition switch on
"his dash. BAM! The seat is knocked loose, and Enrique's gun *"
"goes flying, but Enrique remains in the car. *"
Both Brian and Enrique are equally surprised. Brian reacts *
first and hits Enrique with a right elbow to the nose. *
Enrique fights back and it's on. *
"As they battle in the car, Brian sees that Enrique's seat is *"
loose and his seat-belt is destroyed. Brian gets in three
good shots in a row then pops Enrique's door open. *
He presses the nitrous button on the steering wheel and
"rockets the car forward, the bridge warping around him. The"
wind rips the suicide door open and then right off the car.
Enrique gets his senses back just in time to see how fast *


"Enrique's seat rips free, and he smashes nose first into the *"
windshield.
"Brian turns and kicks the seat, and it and Enrique go *"
tumbling out the door onto the highway.
"Brian guns the car and races through the gears, his car"
eating up the pavement. He snatches up his radio.
"BRIAN (cont'd) Yo, Rome!"
PEARCE
"Yeah, man. We' re all clear."
BRIAN

Verone paces impatiently in the cargo area. Clemente does *
her best to stay cool.



"He stops, squinting at the movement in the foliage. He can't"
"believe it, zeroing in on a camouflaged Agent squatting"
there.
VERONE
They've made us.
He turns to Clemente.
VERONE {cont'd)
It's a set-up.
But his jaw drops as he sees her face. She's smiling. Her *
hand is already forming into a fist.
CLEMENTE
(calmly) *
"F.B.I., carter. Don't move. *"
She wallops him with a fist that starts from around her belt *
"area, BAM! He flops backwards. *"
CLEMENTE (cont'd) *
(smart-ass) *
I told you not to move. *
"He wipes the blood from his lip, and a light forms in his *"

"Verone and Clemente get to their feet, and start going at it"
"again, as the pilot tries to steer the plane with one arm."
Verone loves that Clemente can handle herself. It makes

"punch and pops him one, two, three times in the gut. *"

Consider this derby day.

the cockpit. She can see... *
EXT. AIRFIELD - TARMAC - DAY 223

"game of chicken. He checks his seat belt, gulps, then looks"
at the plane with renewed resolve.

oncoming tires. He's not giving in.

up the back ramp and into the cargo area of the plane.

the middle of the cargo hold.
EXT. AIRFIELD - TARMAC - DAY 227
"Clemente's sharp turn causes the plane to bank hard, flipping *"
"so that one wing drags the ground, forcing the plane into an"

over and

At least I can say I shared my bed
with a cop.

CLEMENTE
And now you can share plenty with
your own kind.

cut the back of the plane open. Pearce stumbles up. *
"Just then, the saws cut through the hinges and the whole ramp"
comes tumbling off.

Nothing but smoke and darkness. Then light makes its way into the cargo bay as everyone peers in.

for the swarm of agents by the plane.
They both hop down from the ambulance. *
